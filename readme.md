Bass
====

From https://byuu.org/tool/bass/

bass is a table-driven, patching cross assembler.

Unlike a traditional assembler, there is no linker stage: assembly code is patched directly onto existing images. It is primarily intended for modifying existing binaries; although it is fast enough to build complete programs from scratch as well.

Currently, it supports the WDC 65816 and Sony SPC700 CPUs.
